Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input: 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Solution 1:
Brute Force Approach:
The extremely naive solution, we can think of, involves the use of an extra array. The algorithm is as follows.

Algorithm:
Suppose, there are N-X zeros and X non-zero elements in the array.
We will first copy those X non-zero elements from the original array to a temporary array.
Then, we will copy the elements from the temporary array one by one and fill the first X places of the original array.
The last N-X places of the original array will be then filled with zero. Now, our task is completed.

Optimal Approach(Using 2 pointers):
We can optimize the approach using 2 pointers i.e. i and j.
The pointer j will point to the first 0 in the array and i will point to the next index.

Algorithm:
First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j].
Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i].
So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.
